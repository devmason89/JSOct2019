//* Expressions

//Set a variable to be a function

let hey = function hi () {
    console.log('hi');
}

//we turned it into an expression by giving it a variable name. The variable "hey" is now representative of the function 'hi()';

//Difference between a declaration and an expression is that declarations get hoisted and expressions do not get hoisted.
